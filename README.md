> A revolutionary intent-driven, AI-native operating system architecture designed to make computing as natural and adaptive as fluid, and as intelligent as a neural system.

## üìñ Overview

The Neuro-Fluidic Architecture (NFA) is an open-source meta-architecture framework for building future AI operating systems. It represents a fundamental paradigm shift from application-centric to **intent-driven** computation, where the system's primary role is to understand user goals (`what`) and dynamically orchestrate resources to achieve them, rather than simply executing pre-defined commands (`how`).

NFA enables the creation of adaptive, self-optimizing systems that seamlessly span devices, edge nodes, and cloud infrastructure, forming a collective intelligence network while prioritizing user privacy and agency.

## ‚ú® Core Tenets

- **Intent-Driven:** Systems behave based on understanding user intent, not just executing pre-defined commands.
- **Neuro-Fluidic:** Combines advanced cognitive capabilities (`Neuro`) with dynamically adaptive resource allocation (`Fluidic`).
- **Inherently Federated:** Designed for privacy-aware collaboration across devices, edge, and cloud using federated learning and privacy-preserving technologies.
- **Self-Optimizing:** Continuously learns and adapts to user behavior, environment changes, and resource availability.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The NFA is structured into three conceptual layers:

### 1. Cognitive & Conscious Layer
- **Meta-Agent:** The strategic orchestrator that understands high-level user intent and decomposes it into actionable tasks.
- **Ethical Framework ("Tao"):** Built-in mechanisms for explainable AI, fairness auditing, and ethical constraint enforcement.

### 2. Execution & Reflex Layer
- **Arts Mesh:** A dynamic service mesh where capabilities are declared as "intents" rather than fixed APIs, enabling automatic service discovery and composition.
- **Flow Scheduler:** A neuro-symbolic resource manager that combines machine learning prediction with symbolic reasoning for optimal resource allocation.
- **Natural Interaction Engine:** Unified interface for multimodal interactions (voice, vision, gesture, BCI) that adapts to context.

### 3. Being & Sense Layer
- **Unified Hardware Abstraction (UHA):** Consistent interface across diverse hardware (CPU/GPU/TPU/quantum/neuromorphic).
- **Sensor Fusion Hub:** Integrates data from various environmental and biological sensors.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.70+ or Go 1.20+ (depending on which components you're building)
- Protocol Buffers compiler
- (Optional) NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit for GPU acceleration

### Building from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/neuro-fluidic-architecture/nfa-core.git
cd nfa-core

# Build the core components
make build

# Run tests
make test

# Start a local development node
make run-dev
```

### Using the Intent Programming SDK

1. **Install the NFA CLI:**
```bash
cargo install nfa-cli
```

2. **Create your first intent service:**
```bash
nfa new --type=intent-service my-translator
cd my-translator
```

3. **Define your service's capabilities in `translator.intent.yaml`:**
```yaml
version: v1alpha
kind: IntentContract
metadata:
  name: com.example.translator
  description: "A multi-language translation service"
spec:
  intentPatterns:
    - pattern: 
        action: translate
        content: @text
        from: @sourceLanguage
        to: @targetLanguage
      constraints:
        targetLanguage: ["zh", "en", "fr", "de"]
        
  implementation:
    endpoint:
      type: grpc
      port: 50051
      procedure: TranslateText
```

4. **Implement your service logic and register it with the local Intent Broker.**

See our [Developer Guide](docs/developer-guide.md) for detailed instructions.

## üìã Current Status

NFA is currently in active development. The following components are available in early alpha:

- [ ] Intent Description Language (IDL) specification
- [x] Intent Runtime (Go implementation)
- [x] Intent Broker (Rust implementation)
- [x] NFA CLI tool
- [ ] Flow Scheduler (early prototype)
- [ ] Unified Hardware Abstraction (planning phase)

Check our [Roadmap](docs/ROADMAP.md) for detailed progress and upcoming features.
